Merge Intervals
You are given a list of intervals, where each interval is represented as [start, end]. Your task is to merge all overlapping intervals and return a list of the merged intervals in ascending order of their start times. Two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] overlap if b >= c.

Input 
The first line contains a single integer 𝑛, the number of intervals.
Each of the next 𝑛 lines contains two integers, representing the start and end of each interval.

Output
Print the merged intervals, each on a new line, in the form [start, end].
