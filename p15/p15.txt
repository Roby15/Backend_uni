Unique Paths
You are given an 𝑚×𝑛 grid, where you are located at the top-left corner (0, 0) and want to reach the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1). You can only move either down or right at any point in time. Determine the number of unique paths from the start to the destination.

Input
A single line containing two integers, 𝑚 and 𝑛, representing the number of rows and columns of the grid.

Output
A single integer representing the total number of unique paths from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid.
