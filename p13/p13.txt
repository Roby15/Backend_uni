Spiral Matrix
Given an 𝑀×𝑁 matrix of integers, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order, starting from the top-left element and proceeding in a clockwise direction.

Input 
The first line contains two integers 
𝑀 and 𝑁, representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.
The next 
𝑀 lines each contain 𝑁 integers separated by spaces, representing the elements of the matrix.

Output 
A single line with the elements of the matrix in spiral order, separated by spaces.
