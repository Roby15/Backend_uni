Roman to Integer
Given a Roman numeral, convert it to an integer. The input Roman numeral is guaranteed to be a valid Roman numeral between 1 and 3999.

Roman Numeral Rules:
Roman numerals are represented by the characters: I, V, X, L, C, D, M.
The numeral values are as follows:
I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, M = 1000
Roman numerals are usually written from largest to smallest from left to right. However, when a smaller numeral appears before a larger numeral, it is subtracted from the larger value (e.g., IV = 4, IX = 9).

Input
A single line containing a string representing a valid Roman numeral.

Output 
A single integer representing the integer value of the Roman numeral.
