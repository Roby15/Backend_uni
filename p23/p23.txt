Valid Parentheses
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:

The brackets must close in the correct order.
Every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
For example:

"()" is valid.
"()[]{}" is valid.
"(]" is not valid.
"([)]" is not valid.
"{[]}" is valid.
Input
A single string containing only the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', and ']'.

Output
A single line: "Valid" if the parentheses are valid, or "Invalid" if they are not.
