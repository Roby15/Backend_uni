Pascal's Triangle
Given a non-negative integer 𝑛, generate the first 𝑛 rows of Pascal's Triangle.

In Pascal's Triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with the number 1 at the top.

Input 
A single integer 𝑛, the number of rows of Pascal's Triangle to generate.

Output
𝑛 lines, where each line represents a row of Pascal's Triangle. Each row's elements should be separated by a single space.
