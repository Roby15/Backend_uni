Ugly Number
An "ugly number" is a positive integer whose prime factors only include 2, 3, and 5. By convention:

1 is considered an ugly number.
Any positive integer that can be factored only by the numbers 2, 3, and 5 is considered ugly.
If a number has any prime factor other than 2, 3, or 5, it is not an ugly number.
Given a number 𝑛, determine if it is an ugly number.

Input
A single integer 𝑛, the number to check.

Output 
A single line with the word "Ugly" if the number is an ugly number, or "Not Ugly" if it is not.
